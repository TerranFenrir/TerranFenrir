- 👋 Hey there! Pri here! I'm currently developing (or at least trying to) a decentralised social media platform with the name of "Vargar".
- 🌱 I’m currently learning or developing skills in the ReactNative development sphere. I also plan on learning Rust soon.....
- 💞️ Currently, I'm looking to collaborate on Vargar and anything associated with it. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Well...I'm hoping you could reach me on Vargar itself, but till it's messaging functionality isn't active, we gotta stick with the crappy email system I suppose....Anyways...Here's my email: priyavratjoglekarofficial@protonmail.com
